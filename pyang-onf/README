The original README file is available as README.pyang!

Usage instruction for ONF Configuration Management:
===================================================

Make sure you have a Unix like environment. This version was tested
on Linux and Cygwin. You need at least python 2.6 to get pyang to work.

You need to enter the root directory of the pyang distribution and
source the "env.sh" file with your shell to get the paths for python
libraries right.

After that you can change to the directory where your yang file is
located. To create the schema just issue:

pyang -f xsd --xsd-groups --xsd-no-any-augments file.yang > file.xsd

Then you should get a valid XML schema for the current yang file.
